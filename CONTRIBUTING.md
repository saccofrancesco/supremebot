## ü§ù Contributing

Hi! Thanks for your interest in contributing. This is a personal project currently maintained by a single developer, and contributions are generally not expected. However, if you find a bug, have a suggestion, or want to improve something, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo**
2. **Create a new branch**
   Use a clear and descriptive name like `fix/typo-in-readme` or `feature/improve-layout`.
3. **Make your changes**
   Try to follow the existing code style and structure.
4. **Commit clearly**
   Write concise commit messages that explain *what* you changed and *why*.
5. **Open a pull request**
   Include a short description of your change and link to any related issues, if applicable.

### Notes

* Please be respectful in all communication.
* If you're suggesting a major change or feature, consider opening an issue first to discuss it.
* I may or may not merge external contributions depending on alignment with the project's goals or vision.

Thanks again!
